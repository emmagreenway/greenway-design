        <h2 class="mbr-section-title pb-3 align-center mbr-fonts-style display-2">Capabilities </h2>

        
        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle display-5 align-center">I am a hard working & enthusiastic creative designer with expertise in branding, websites, marketing and events. I’m extremely motivated and driven to provide clients with my absolute best for their business, be that digital or print. With a lively & energetic personality, attention to detail and eager to learn new skills, I bring not only talent but also a smile to the workplace. I will always be happy to bring new ideas to the table, work at a fast pace and contribute to the growth of a team.</br>
Over my extensive career in graphic design I have had the pleasure to work for a variety of in house companies, large and small agencies as well as many businesses. Over these 16 years, 
I have not only been an employee to some of these, but have also successfully started up my own freelance career which has been running for the last 8 years. 
As an employee, I worked in a number of creative fields. My passion for digital and print design and began at high-end publishing house, Macmillan Publishers, which is where I also began my skills in website and email builds, reading and writing HTML and CSS. This continued at The Economist several years later. Following on from this I gained experience creating brand and marketing design for office and residential buildings at a busy agency; Core Marketing & Events when I decided to move back towards my hometown from London. 
I moved into my freelance career creating design collateral for large and small companies. At DPD I worked on redesigning their sales brochures, marketing literature, developing their general look and feel as a company, liaising with the CEO on his events, and creating a catalogue of illustrations for the company. In other roles I have creating window & store displays for JD Sport, Adidas, Puma and Primark. I have created a full suite of new internal boat layouts for Waterspace Living marketing and website use. During my contract to rebrand S4labour, I delivered a new look and feel whilst retaining the existing logo, created for them a wealth of illustrations, templates, event banners, digital and print marketing collateral and email campaigns. The redesigning and build of their brand new website was a particular achievement as was the assistance in the UX and UX of their system and their upcoming apps. Being an integral part of their marketing team in supporting their needs has been highly rewarding in not only knowledge and skills gained but in also the many friendships I made along the way. I am very versatile with my work thanks to all of these opportunities I have had. 
I flourish in a busy environment or in my studio working on multiple projects at a time, making sure I stay on top of the latest design trends to make sure my communication is always relevant. I deliver projects to an excellent standard, keeping up within a busy, fast-paced environment and working successfully towards deadlines. I have a keen eye for detail and proofreading is second nature to me. I am proficient in working from initial concepts right through to final artwork with expert knowledge on pre-press and liaising with print houses.
All my roles have enabled me to develop my customer service, time management, leadership skills and teamwork; all of these feeding into my passion for success. My time management and organization skills have been invaluable - enabling me in prior roles to assist in structuring workloads, which have been a crucial part of day-to-day processes.  I have proven I can manage my own workload as well as having the communication & skills as a capable leader to teach others and guide those more junior to develop their skills further. I not only act as a mentor for other designers in the field but I welcome guidance from more senior designers to grow myself. I don’t feel anyone can ever know too much about design so I keep developing new skills to benefit my clients as well as my own personal interests in website & app builds.
I keep on top of Adobe Creative Suite. My everyday programs consist of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign; in which I am highly proficient to use for both print and digital outputs. Using WordPress along with plugins such as Elementor Divi & Smart Slider 3 as well as Shopify are all platforms I confidently build websites on as well as being able to read and write HTML, CSS & some elements of JavaScript to create non platform based websites and emails. Sketch & Adobe XD are the programs I use for app and website design for UX and UI purposes. I am also confident in building HTML emails from scratch or using Mailchimp as a platform. I am also keen to further new skills in motion graphics and animation as I progress as well as honing existing ones.
I constantly get great feedback from clients on my efficiency and quality and I cope well under pressure. Problem solving has built up trusted relationships with my clients - they see me as being flexible and accommodating to their needs and trust my expertise. Finding the right solutions by digging deep, being unique and listening to what my client wants are the key initial steps I take. I view this communication as being incredibly important to ensure the creative is relevant to the needs of my client. I am not scared to respectfully challenge the right design concept and endeavour to excite my clients with new creative solutions.
I enjoy drawing - hand drawn and vector. A number of my illustrations have been used for big promotional materials and high end catalogues and magazines over the years and more recently I have created a separate brand in which I design personalised items for purchase. This challenge has taken my design style to a new plane in which I am very excited about.</p>
